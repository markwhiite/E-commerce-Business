<h1 align="center"><em>Lightworkin â€“ E-commerce Business (2020â€“2023)</em></h1>


## ðŸ“– Backstory
In May 2020, during the height of the pandemic, I decided to start my own e-commerce business called **Lightworkin**. What began as a small idea â€” designing and selling poster art inspired by music and culture â€” quickly grew into a project that taught me much more than just selling online.  

I started from scratch: no investors, no business background, just an interest in design and a willingness to learn. I built the store on **Shopify**, sourced my own artwork, and marketed primarily through **social media and word of mouth**. My goal was to create affordable, high-quality poster designs that connected with fans of music, art, and culture.  

Within the first few months, sales began to grow, and I scaled operations while balancing school, jobs other commitments. Within 6 months, I generated over *$25k* in revenue. My highest earning month is in** October 2020, with 12k+ in monthly revenue**.By the end of three years, I had fulfilled **800+ orders** and generated **$40K+ in revenue**, all while managing every aspect of the business myself.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
Running Lightworkin gave me **real-world experience** in entrepreneurship, technology, and customer engagement. More importantly, it taught me how to:  
- Take an idea from **concept â†’ launch â†’ growth**
