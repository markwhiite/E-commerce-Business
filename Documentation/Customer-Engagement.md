## Customer Reviews & Community

Through Instagram and other social media tools, I would always keep my **customers engaged and interact with my viewers.** This allows consumer involvement, which can build attraction and demand. I did many giveaways and discount codes, while also posting many reviews and updates on my social media platforms. I also reposted customers who tagged me in stories of their order, to show my appreciation for their purchase and support
